**Secure Communication and Network Attacks** 

**PPP** - Point to Point Encapsulation protocol is designed to support the transmission of IP traffic over dial-up or point-to-point links. 

**PAP** - Password Authentication Protocol - PAP transmits username and passwords in cleartext, it offers no form of encryption; it simply provides a means to transport the logon credentials from the client to the authentication server. 

**Email Security Solution** 
S/MIME
PGP
DKIM
DMARC
STARTTLS
SPF

**Virtual Private Network**
A VPN is a communication channel between two entities across an intermediary untrusted network. VPN's can provide several critical security functions, such as access control, authentication, confidentiality and integrity. Most VPNs use encryption to protect the encapsulated traffic, but encryption is not necessary for the connection to be considered a VPN. A VPN is an example of virtualised network.

**Tunnelling** - Tunnelling is concept of encrypting the data which connects from one end to another end. 

VPN can be used in two mode 
- Transport Mode - Only encrypts payload and doesn't encrypt IP & IPsec Header
- Tunnel Mode - Only encrypts payload and IP Header and doesn't encrypt IPsec Header 


**Circuit Switching** - Circuit Switching was originally developed to manage telephone calls over the public switched telephone network. In circuit switching, a dedicated physical pathway is created between two communication parties. 

**Packet Switching** - It is used for networking communications which doesn't utilise
