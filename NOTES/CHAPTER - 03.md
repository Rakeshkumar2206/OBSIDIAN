*BIA* - Business Impact Analysis 

- Quantitative Analysis - Usage of numbers to get to a value *(Most Preferred)*
- Qualitative Analysis - Usage of Scenarios which could provide and idea of reputational damage etc.

**Initial Process of Quantitative BIA -**

***FIRST STEP -***  Is to identify organizations asset and the *Asset Value (AV)* and provide it a monetary value 
	- *MAXIMUM TOLERABLE DOWNTIME* - It is a value which is calculated where the organization can accept the process downtime until it makes irreparable damage 
	- *RECOVERY TIME OBJECTIVE* - It is a value which is calculated on how fast a process can be again brought back up or recovered from the Disruption 
	- *RECOVERY POINT OBJECTIVE* - It is a time which is calculated for the amount of data which can be recovered before the disruption. 

***SECOND STEP*** - Is to identify the types of risks occurring to the organization 
*RISKS* 
- 2 Types of risks 
	- Natural Risks 
	- Man Made Risks

***THIRD STEP*** - Likelihood Assessment
- *ANNUALISED RATE OF OCCURENCE (AR0)* - It is a value where which the business would experience a particular amount of risk in a given year.
- *EXPOSURE FACTOR (EF)* - It is the amount of damage that the risk posses to the asset.
- *SINGLE LOSS EXPECTANCY (SLE)* - It is the monetary lose expected each time when the risk materializes  
	- ***FORMULA FOR SLE - SLE = AV x EF***
- *ANNUALISED LOSS EXPECTANCY* - Is the monetary loss that the business expects suffer as a result of the risk harming the asset during a typical year 
	- ***FORMULA FOR ALE - ALE = SLE X ARO***

	**EXAMPLE OF QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT**
		- Value of an IP address - Rs.90,000
		**AV - 90000**
		- DDOS - Damage to the asset coz of the DDOS attack
		**EF - 0.80**
		- Now time to calculate SLE
		**SLE = AV X EF**
		SLE = 90000 X 0.80
		**SLE = 72000**
		Now it is time to calculate the ALE, For that we need ARO. ARO can be concluded from the likelihood of that risk being exposed 
		**ARO = 2**
		ALE = SLE X ARO 
		ALE = 72000 X 2
		**ALE = 144000**
	- Now they can Expect an Annual Loss Expectancy of Rs.144000 for that specific IP Address going down
