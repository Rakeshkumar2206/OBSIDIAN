**Motion Detectors** 
A motion Detectors, or motion sensor is a device that senses movement or sound in a specific area, and it is a common element of intruder detection systems. Many types of motion detectors exist, including the following:
- A digital motion detector monitors for a significant or meaningful changes in the digital pattern of a monitored are. This is effectively a smart security camera
- A passive infrared or heart based motion detector monitors for significant or meaningful changes in the hear levels and patterns in a monitored area
