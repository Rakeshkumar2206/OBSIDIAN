	**MALICIOUS CODE AND APPLICATION ATTACKS**

*Virus Propagation Techniques*
- Master Boot Record Viruses (MBR)
- File Infector Virus
- Macro Viruses
- Service Injection Viruses

*Virus Technologies*
 - Multipartie Viruses - Can infect critical come and exe files and also can infect MBR, if a same virus is able to do multiple infections then it is called out multipartie viruses.
 - Stealth Viruses - They hide themselves by actually tampering with the operating systems to fool av.
 - Polymorphic Viruses - They modify their own code while moving from one system to another thus tough to identify them as they modify their signature while doing this.
	 - Encrypted Viruses - It uses encrypted use of cryptographic signature which are encrypted and thus changes their signature by encrypting and decrypting themselves.
